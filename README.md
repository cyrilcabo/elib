An online library served for EVSU-TC students.

ELib is a web application aimed to provide students of Eastern Visayas State University easy access over millions of resources with just a few clicks. It serves as an online library, closing the gaps between students and information. Due to the pandemic, it was realized that better systems are to be created, in order to cater the needs of the students. Therefore, it was imperative to utilize technologies available, so that the students are not left behind.
